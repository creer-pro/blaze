# XBase Template: Blaze

Blaze as part of the XBase Templates Collection is implemented using the lovely Tailwind CSS framework to be a general purpose template. You can customize and use it in any ways you wish.

Everything is clear...

## Installation

The template doesn't need any installation unless if you need to develop and customize it using Tailwind CSS. To do so you can use `npm` to install the packages needed for the Tailwind JIT engine to work:

* To install the development packages:  
``` npm install ```

* To run the JIT Watch:  
``` npm run watch ```

* To build the production styles:  
``` npm run build ```
