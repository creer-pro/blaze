_**Blaze**_ is a free HTML template and is implemented using the lovely **Tailwind CSS** framework. You can customize and use it in any ways you wish.

Everything in the code is made clear and simple. So you just need to know a bit about HTML and Tailwind CSS (if necessary) to be able to customize this template.

## Installation

The template doesn't need any installation unless if you need to develop and customize it using Tailwind CSS. To do so you can use `npm` to install the packages needed for Tailwind CSS to watch your files for changes and generate the styles:

- To install the development packages:  

```shell
npm install 
```

- To start watching files for automatic CSS class generation:  

```shell 
npm run watch 
```

- To build the production styles (minified CSS code):  

```shell 
npm run build 
```

## Code Structure

The code is structured in a simple and easily understandable way. Read the rest if you want to know more.

### Files

Let's take a look at the files tree, first:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ res
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ tailwind.css
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ img
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ logos
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ svg
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### `index.html`

The `index.html` file contains all the html you need for the template. To avoid any fuss and complication, all the HTML code you need is put in here which can be simply edited. 

If you don't know Tailwind CSS you can refer to it's documentation on [TailwindCSS.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to learn about it effectively. There's everything you need to know about this beautiful framework out there.

### `tailwind.config.js` and customizing it

The `tailwind.config.js` at the root of this directory contains all Tailwind's configuration for this template. it contains the config for *colors*, *font* and *backgrounds* used in this template. You can customize them as you wish.

### `res\`

This directory contains all the resources the template needs. From CSS to images, svg files and almost everything.

### `res\css`

This directory contains two files:

- `styles.css`: keeps the styles generated by Tailwind CSS.
- `tailwind.css`: keeps your custom styles that the JIT Compiler uses to generate the `styles.css` file. If you want to add your `@apply` styles you can put them here and then run `npm run build` to generate the css styles you need. While developing, you can run `npm run watch` and the styles will be generated when you hit save on your editor.

### Watch / Build

The `package.json` has two scripts defined in it:

- **`watch`**: which you can use to run the _Just In Time compiler_ of Tailwind CSS to watch the `index.html` file to generate your styles on the go. The generated styles will be saved in `res/css/styles.css`. To run the `watch` command just run `npm run watch` in your command line inside the project's root.

- **`build`**: used to generate production styles. It takes the classes from `index.html` and `res/css/tailwind.css` and generates a minified, production ready styles into `res/css/styles.css`. To run the `build` command just run `npm run build` in your command line inside the project's root.
